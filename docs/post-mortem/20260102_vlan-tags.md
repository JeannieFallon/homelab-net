# Post-Mortem: VLAN 20 Connectivity Issue

**Date:** 2026-01-02

**Component:** Proxmox Networking / Orbi VLAN Trunking

## Symptom

Virtual Machines assigned to VLAN 20 were unable to acquire a DHCP lease and
hung during networking service restarts, despite the Orbi router having a
healthy DHCP pool for that segment.

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

The issue was a **PVID (Port VLAN ID) Mismatch**.

*   **Orbi Configuration:** The physical port was set to a specific VLAN 20
   profile in "Trunk" mode. In this specific hardware implementation, the
   router was already assigning untagged incoming traffic to VLAN 20 (acting as
   the Native VLAN/PVID).

*   **Proxmox Configuration:** The VM was configured with an 802.1Q tag of 20.

> **The Conflict:** This resulted in "Double Tagging." The Orbi dropped the
packets because they arrived already tagged, rather than arriving "clean" for
the router to handle.

## Resolution

Removed the VLAN tag from the VM's Virtual Network Interface (vNIC) in Proxmox.
This allowed the VM to send untagged traffic, which the Orbi then correctly
tagged and routed to the VLAN 20 gateway.

## Lessons Learned

When offloading VLAN management to a "VLAN-aware" physical switch/router port,
ensure the Hypervisor is not redundantizing the tags unless the switch is
configured for a "Strict Tagged" member policy.
